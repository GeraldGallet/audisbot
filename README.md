# audisbot's git

## Getting started
### Installation
Run these commands to get started : \
```npm install``` \
``npm start`` \

Copy the content of `default_commands.js` to `commands.js`. `commands.js` will be your saved commands, just do this again if you want to reset everything.
### Usage
Run `!list` to see everything that the bot can do, and start having fun

## Commands
### Vocal commands
Vocal commands will make the bot play an audio in your vocal channel. Currently this audio can be either a downloaded mp3, or  youtube video. \

You can create a new command by using the `!addvocal` one, and it will automatically be saved in your configurations, so you won't lose it when closing the bot. \

To download a mp3, you can either do it by hand, or use the `!download` command.
